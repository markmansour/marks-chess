This is a straight forward chess engine written in Java.  The chess engine comes with a basic UCI interface.  There are thorough unit tests.  There is *no* GUI.

## Chess Engine Capabilities
The project contains a chess engine with following abilities:
* Understands all valid moves including castling, en passant, and promotion.
* Understands checkmate, stalemate, the 50 rule move, insufficient materials, and repetition.
* Basic UCI interface.
* Uses bitboards (and [Magic bitboards](https://rhysre.net/fast-chess-move-generation-with-magic-bitboards.html)) for speed.  This was a lot of fun to write.
* Perft 7 running (correctly) at 4MM nodes/second on my M2 macbook air.  Perft 7 for Java requires moving 
  from ints to longs (64 bit) to support the higher number of nodes.
* Four working players.  
  * RandomMovePlayer - generates moves to a depth of 1 and randomly picks a move.
  * BasicNegaMaxPlayer - uses nagamax (minimax) with a [Simple Evaluation Function](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Simplified_Evaluation_Function) 
    (values in centipawns) and [Piece-Square Tables](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Simplified_Evaluation_Function#Piece-Square_Tables).
  * AlphaBetaPlayer with alpha/beta pruning (Simple evaluation and PSTs).
  * AlphaBetaPlayerTT with alpha/beta and transposition tables.
* Move ordering (basic version implemented to prioritize captures) and improved move ordering ([MVV-LVA](https://www.chessprogramming.org/MVV-LVA)).
* Zobrist keys to find repetition and support speed improvements during search.

## Design
* **Game** - contains only game state such as clock moves, draw/checked/mate/repetition/50 move rule, the active player, and a history of moves.  Players make moves in the game object, which updates the underlying board.  The Game object deals in moves including move generation and enforces correctness of moves.
* **Board** - this class represents the board layout including where pieces are placed, and hashes of the board state.  It does not enforce correctness.
* **Pieces** - com.stateofflux.chess.model.pieces.*: This package attempts to encapsulate all piece logic.
* **Players** - logic to determine how to move pieces on the board.  Includes search and evaluation functions.  In traditional chess engines this is called artificial intelligence.

## Build
Built against [Amazon Corretto JDK 17](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-17-ug/what-is-corretto-17.html) and Apache Maven 3.9+.

If you're building the project on the command line then to get started:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/markmansour/marks-chess.git
$ cd marks-chess
$ mvn package assembly:single
```

## Playing against other engines
Build a single jar file with all dependencies, and call it from a shell script.  That
shell script can be called from a chess engine.

```bash
$ ~./app.sh
```

I use this script as a launch for GUIs such as [cutechess](https://github.com/cutechess/cutechess) or banksia on macOS.

# Why?
## Goals
* Have fun!  It's been years since I've regularly programmed and this project is my way of re-engaging with programming.  And there are 1000s of chess engines in existence, so I have absolutely no intention of commercializing this code.
* Re-familiarize myself with the Java ecosystem (including AssertJ, JUnit, TestNG, Google Guava, SpotBugs, Maven, etc.).
* Experiment with benchmarking frameworks (using [async profiler](https://github.com/async-profiler/async-profiler)).
* Experiment with 3rd party services (such as GitHub actions)
* Move from theory to practice with Neural Nets.

## Non-goals
* Make a competitive chess engine.  If it happens, then that's a nice (but unexpected) bonus.
* Write production quality code.  This is for fun, and I'm *sure* my classes could be factored in a much cleaner way.

The below notes are mainly for me, but I'll leave them in as they may help others.
